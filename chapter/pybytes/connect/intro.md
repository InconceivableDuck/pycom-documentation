## Step 2: Connect your device
After completing your add device wizard, you have two ways of adding your device to Pybytes. You can choose between the quick setup (running the firmware updater with the device's token provided by Pybytes), or you can flash Pybytes library yourself (download the pybytes library and upload it on your device using PyMakr).

Select your option for more instructions:

[Quick add device](add-device-quick.md);

[Flash library](add-device-flashlib.md).
