# Example

## Step 1: Add Device Wizard
On Pybytes' sidebar, click on the icon ``Devices``.
Click on the link ``Add Device``.

- Select your device (e.g., WiPy, LoPy, SiPy, etc.);
- Select your shield (e.g., PySense, PyTrack, PyScan or other);
- Select your network option;
- Enter a unique name for your device;
- Enter the Wi-Fi credentials for your device (SSID and password).

## Step 2: Connect your device
After completing your add device wizard, you have two ways of adding your device to Pybytes. You can choose between the quick setup (running the firmware updater with the device's token provided by Pybytes), or you can flash Pybytes library yourself (download the pybytes library and upload it on your device using PyMakr).

Select your option for more instructions:
[Quick add device](add-device-quick.md);
[Flash library](add-device-flashlib.md).

# Done!
Now it's time to set up your device's dashboard. You can check more about it [here!](../pybytes/4_dashboard/intro.md)
