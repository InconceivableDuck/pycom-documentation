# Add device by flashing Pybytes library

From firmware 1.16.x onwards all Pycom devices come with Pybytes library build-in `/frozen` folder.
That means that you can [add your device quickly](quick-add-device.md) without the need of flashing Pybytes library manually.

Still if you want to extend Pybytes library or add your code `main.py` file you have an option to 
flash Pybytes library manually.

Pybytes library written to `/flash` folder and will take precedence over build in firmware libraries
in `/frozen` folder.
